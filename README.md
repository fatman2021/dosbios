# MS-DOS 2.0 restoration project

A reimplementation of the missing parts needed to run MS-DOS 2.0 (MBR, DBR, **DOS BIOS**, FORMAT, FDISK).

Done mostly **for fun**, and because AFAIK there was no **freely redistributable** drop-in replacement of the closed-source IBMBIO.COM (IO.SYS).

Allows to actually **run and install** MS-DOS 2.0 on a PC.

Includes support for **3.5"** floppy disks and a single hard disk partition of size up to **whooping 20 MiB**.

Also includes the CON, PRN, AUX and CLOCK$ device drivers.

Works best on a PC with **640 KiB** of RAM :-D
